These are agents that will work with gym and Atari
These are two different agents one that is inspired by how I would play it
The other going simply going from left to right

To install either of the these agents
Make sure to import the function from the program into yours
example for both
import space_invaders_human_inspire
import space_invaders_row_by_row
This will make it possible to use the Agent function 
Note there are others functions that the Agent needs 
Therefore you shouldn't import only the Agent function
From there call the Agent and place the eviroment action space in it
After that call act, the observation, reward and done
From there it will return the appropriate action for that moment
